About me

A strategic technology leader and infrastructure architect with over 14 years of progressive experience, I specialize in designing and securing enterprise-scale IT environments that drive operational excellence and digital transformation. Backed by an MSc in Computer Science with a specialization in Security Engineering from the University of Moratuwa - Sri Lanka, I bring deep technical expertise and a forward-thinking approach to cybersecurity, cloud computing, and enterprise systems integration.

My core competencies span advanced network architecture, including enterprise routing, switching, firewalls, wireless infrastructure, and end-to-end system design. I have hands-on expertise with leading virtualization platforms such as VMware vSAN and Nutanix, and I am highly skilled in managing Microsoft Windows Server 2022 environments, encompassing Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, and WDS. My cloud experience includes deploying and managing solutions across AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure with O365.

I am also proficient in a wide range of open-source technologies that enhance system monitoring, automation, and security. These include Zabbix, Libra, SIEM - Wazuh, Splunk, Smokeping, the ELK Stack, Docker, Kubernetes, Apache, Nginx, Radius, Keycloak, Moodle LMS, and OSTicket—tools I regularly integrate to support high availability, observability, and secure operations.

In leadership roles, I have driven IT strategic planning, annual budgeting, and procurement processes, including the development of BOQs and RFPs. As Chairman of multiple IT tender evaluations, I’ve overseen project governance while ensuring operational alignment and continuity across cross-functional teams.

Beyond the workplace, I am an active contributor to the regional networking community. Since 2019, I have served as an Executive Member of LKNOG and played key roles in SANOG 40 and 41 as a Programme and Fellowship Committee Member. I regularly participate as a trainer and speaker, promoting collaboration and knowledge exchange throughout South Asia.
